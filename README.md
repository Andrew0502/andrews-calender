## Description 

This repository is a daily planner app to help with scheduling one's work day. It dynamically shows you what time of the work day it is and lists out what you have written down in that hour. It stores what you write down in local storage and displays it when you re-open the app.

[Follow this link to use the app yourself!](https://andrew0502.github.io/andrews-calender/)
